                    <h3>What is this about?</h3>

                    <p><a href="http://logstash.net/">Logstash</a> is a tool to collect log files from various sources,
                        parse them into a JSON format and put them into one or more databases, index engines and so
                        forth. In the simplest case you can slurp log files from the filesystem, parse them using grok -
                        a collection of named <a href="http://www.geocities.jp/kosako3/oniguruma/doc/RE.txt">regular
                            expressions</a> - and put them into the integrated elastic search
                        engine with a simple web frontend to search them. In my experience the hardest part is to get
                        the regular expressions for parsing the log files right. The <a
                                href="http://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/">Grok debugger</a> can help you test your regular
                        expressions and provides Grok Discovery that sometimes can suggest regular expressions. This
                        site, GrokConstructor, goes beyond that by providing an
                        incremental construction process that helps you to construct a regular expression that matches
                        all of a set of given log lines, and provides you a matcher where you can simultaneously try out
                        your regular expression on several log lines. You can find

                    <p> The <a href="do/construction">incremental construction of grok expressions</a> aides you in a
                        step by step construction of a grok regular expression that simultaneously matches all of a
                        given set of log lines. </p>

                    <p> As input you provide those lines to match and select the libraries of grok patterns you want to
                        choose from, and possibly give additional patterns.</p>

                    <p>The construction starts with <code>\A</code> (beginning of string) as an expression.
                        In each step you are prompted to select either a common prefix of the yet unmatched rests of the
                        log lines, or select one of the patterns from the grok library that matches a start segment of
                        all rests of the log lines, or input a pattern that matches the next segment. In each case the
                        next segment is usually the next logical entity to be parsed in the lines.</p>

                    <h3>Matcher</h3>

                    <p>The matcher allows you to <a href="do/match">try out grok expressions</a> on a couple of log
                        lines simultaneously. It shows for all lines whether they are matched, and displays the named
                        groups that result from matching the line.</p>

                    <p>If the expression matches only a start segment of the line the unmatched rest is displayed. If a
                        line is not matched at all we show the longest prefix of the expression that matches the
                        line.</p>

                    <p> As input you provide those lines to match and select the libraries of grok patterns you want to
                        choose from, and possibly give additional patterns.</p>

                    <h3>Automatic Construction</h3>

                    <p> My first attempt was to try a <a href="do/automatic">automatic construction</a> of grok regular
                        expressions. Unfortunately, the algorithm generates too many results to be usable on real world
                        examples, so this is included more for fun than for usefulness.</p>

                    <p> The algorithm starts with <code>\A</code> as an expression. If all the not yet unmatched parts
                        of the log lines start with identical strings that are not alphanumeric, the longest string of
                        such characters is appended to the expression. If not, we find for all grok patterns from the
                        library that match all unmatched rests of the log lines simultaneously. If several patterns
                        match exactly the same strings in every log line, they are grouped together and presented as a
                        drop down list. Since the number of possible regular expressions grows exponentially with the
                        length of the lines, the result list is cut off at 200 results.
